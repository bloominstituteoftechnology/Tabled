Why use animation in the table when adding, removing, or reordering items?
It makes it visually easy for user to understand what they are doing.

Why use a model? Why not just update an array of items directly in your table?
To follow model, view controller, but also, to keep data organized for editing later on by oneself, or colleagues.

When do you call reloadData? When don't you?
You call reloadData when you want the table view to update and show new data.  You don't do this when you don't want to reload data.
