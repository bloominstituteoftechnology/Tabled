What is delegation and why do iOS developers use it?

Delegation safely lets view talk to view controllers.



Why is a table view's data source a kind of delegation? And how does it differ from a table view's delegate?



Why use animation in the table when adding, removing, or reordering items?
So that the user knows changes have occurred.


Why use a model? Why not just update an array of items directly in your table?
Make apps easier to read for yourself and other programmers.


When do you call reloadData? When don't you?
After you have made changes call reloadData. You don't do this when all data is the same.
