Day 4 Freeform questions
1. What is delegation and why do developers use it?
Delegation is a pattern used by developers in which objects (a delegator) hand off selected
responsibilities to another object (the delegate).


2. Why is a table view's data source a kind of delegation? And how does
it differ from a table view's delegate?
Table View has a data source and delegate. They are both a kind of delegation because
the Table View does not know on its own without requesting a data source what it should
display. It has "delegated" its responsibility to know its contents to data source.
It does differ from the Table View delegate in that what that delegation involves is the
instructions (such and number of rows or sections) for its actual construction.
In this case, independent of what it needs to display, the table view has outsourced even
the details of its "structure".

3. Why use animation in the table when adding, removing, or reordering items?
We use animation in order to maintain good and consistent user experience.

4. Why use a model? Why not just update an array of items directly in your table?
This is so that a model can be reused in other applications without being hard coded with
any given application's specific data. This is part of the MVC pattern, which addition to
separating the data from the model also provides safety.

5. When do you call reloadData ? When don't you?
Reload data is called each time a controller is called upon to modify data. It is not called
if data is simply read.
