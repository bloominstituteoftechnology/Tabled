Delegation is simply assigning or passing the responsibility. iOS developers use this because it's a neat, safe and clean way to for the one thing(table view) to assign responsibilities to another thing(view controller).

It's is the source of data in respect to the table view. The table view delegate is controller the views and rows.

Animation makes these actions work and be seen by users.

A model allows for reusability and it's organized.

We only call reloadData with viewDidLoad and the App delegate. Every where we use that specific method.
