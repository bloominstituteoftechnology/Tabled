//Delegation: Delegation basically makes it so that a type can be used in many different contexts and when it's clear who the owner is in all of those contexts.
// Delegates are used to pass data between structs and classes.
//Data sources are in control of the data. It's an outlet that's held by NSView and UIView and requires a source to populate rows of visible data. They're objects that must be present in order to receive messages from any oject that is requesting data.
//So that it saves our changes.
// The data source or delegate will call this method when it wants the table view to completely reload the data. When we wouldn't want to use it is when we're deleting rows.
